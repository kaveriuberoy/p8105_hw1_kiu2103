The variables in the `early_january_weather` dataset are: `r paste(names(early_january_weather), collapse = ", ")`.

The size of the `early_january_weather` dataset is `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.

The mean temperature for the early January weather dataset is `r mean(early_january_weather[["temp"]], na.rm = TRUE)`.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature vs Time (Colored by Humidity)",
       x = "Time (in hours) from January 1st morning to January 14th night",
       y = "Temperature (Â°F)",
       color = "Humidity") +
